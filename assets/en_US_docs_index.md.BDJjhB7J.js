Its Logo is composed of a star ring representing &quot;the world&quot; and a train representing &quot;shuttle&quot;, just as we often hear on the train, &quot;The train from xx to xx...&quot; The same, symbolizing shuttling through the online world.</p><p>Whenever a user visits the webpage that joins &quot;Travellings&quot;, clicking the &quot;To&quot; button on that webpage will randomly redirect to another webpage that joins the project. Whether you click &quot;Drive to&quot; again or back off the webpage, you will continue to be randomly redirected to the webpages of other participants.</p><p>As of now, &quot;Travellings&quot; has attracted the attention of over 1,000 people, and over 1,000 members have joined the project. As more and more web pages choose to join the &quot;Travellings&quot; group, our friendly link network is also constantly expanding, which will further drive the growth of shared traffic and inject more vitality into this project.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/travellings-link/travellings/stargazers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/travellings-link/travellings?style=social" alt="GitHub stars"></a></p><h2 id="links" tabindex="-1">Links <a class="header-anchor" href="#links" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Links&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Click here <a href="https://list.travellings.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">View member list</a></li><li>Click here <a href="https://www.travellings.cn/en_US/docs/join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">to view the requirements for joining the destination</a></li><li>Click here <a href="https://www.travellings.cn/en_US/docs/qa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">View FAQ</a></li><li>Click here <a href="https://www.travellings.cn/en_US/docs/toyou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">to view the requirements for joining the maintenance group</a></li></ul><h2 id="project-recommendation" tabindex="-1">Project Recommendation <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-recommendation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Project Recommendation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This project is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">webring</a> project, and here are some similar projects:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.foreverblog.cn/notice/16.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">虫洞-随机访问十年之约成员博客</a></li><li><a href="https://storeweb.cn/s/1818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">个站商店虫洞-随机访问个站商店上的网站</a></li><li><a href="https://zhblogs.ohyee.cc/go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">中文博客列表导航随机跳转-随机访问中文博客</a></li></ul>',11),d=[l,s,h,c];function p(g,u,b,f,m,_){return o(),a("div",null,d)}const k=r(n,[["render",p]]);export{v as __pageData,k as default};
