In this environment, the traffic of standalone web pages (similar to &quot;indie games&quot;) is more or less affected. Travellings attempts to make traditional backlinks &quot;active,&quot; allowing web pages to relay traffic to each other, fostering a flow of traffic, and opening up the internet.</p><p>In theory, Travellings can increase web traffic.</p><p>With a rough estimate: Suppose there are currently 2 web pages joined Travellings, with 10 users using Travellings on each page, then each page seems to increase <code>10*2*1/2=10</code> traffic; if 10 web pages join Travellings, will each still increase 10 traffic on average? Obviously not, because:</p><ul><li>Visitors can use Travellings through multiple backlinks;</li><li>With more web pages having Travellings, single-site traffic will also increase;</li></ul><p>So let&#39;s recalculate, with 10 web pages joined Travellings, the relay times increase to 3, and each page has 15 users using Travellings, then each page increases <code>15*10*3/10=45</code> traffic. This is also why it is recommended to place the Travellings badge in a prominent position on your website (recommended in the top bar, sidebar), to keep the backlinks active and gain more traffic.</p><p>Currently, more webmasters are applying to join, so it is believed that Travellings is beneficial to web traffic — at least webmasters can make friends with each other 😉</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li>For webmasters: Show your support for an open internet and potentially gain more traffic.</li><li>For visitors: Discover more quality web pages, a spontaneous online journey.</li></ul><h2 id="q-does-it-only-accept-blog-sites-to-join" tabindex="-1">Q: Does it only accept blog sites to join? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-does-it-only-accept-blog-sites-to-join" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Does it only accept blog sites to join?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: <strong>All types of websites are qualified to join.</strong></p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether your website is a blog, a homepage, a tool, or a website navigation category. You are always welcome to join the Travellings project with your love of sharing.</p><h2 id="q-what-s-the-current-project-expenditure" tabindex="-1">Q: What&#39;s the current project expenditure? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-s-the-current-project-expenditure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What&#39;s the current project expenditure?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A:</p><ul><li>Server: ¥50/month, used to maintain the project, such as statistical data and observing the online status of member websites.</li><li>Domain: ¥7/month, for renewing the project&#39;s .cn domain, averaged monthly over the year.</li></ul><h2 id="q-is-travellings-safe-and-secure" tabindex="-1">Q: Is Travellings safe and secure? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-is-travellings-safe-and-secure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Is Travellings safe and secure?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Travellings prioritizes security and privacy.</p><p>All HTTPS to prevent hijacking; fully open-source both front and back end, respecting privacy; automatic deployment of mirrors, no manual intervention. Websites joining Travellings are all manually reviewed to ensure clean and high-quality traffic from the source.</p><h2 id="q-what-does-each-status-in-the-patrol-mean" tabindex="-1">Q: What does each status in the patrol mean? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-does-each-status-in-the-patrol-mean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What does each status in the patrol mean?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A:</p><ul><li>RUN: Everything is normal.</li><li>LOST: The website is alive, but the Travellings badge is not found.</li><li>ERROR: The website has abnormalities.</li><li>Pure numbers: Indicates that the site returned a status code other than 200.</li><li>TIMEOUT: Indicates that the backend patrol exceeded 15 seconds when trying to connect to the site.</li><li>WAIT: Indicates pending, usually due to content violations or other special reasons.

Generally, requests within a day will not exceed 10 times, and appropriate throttling can be applied to prevent this feature from being exploited by malicious users.</p><h2 id="q-why-is-my-website-marked-as-lost" tabindex="-1">Q: Why is my website marked as LOST? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-is-my-website-marked-as-lost" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why is my website marked as LOST?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Travellings currently uses Axios (Node.JS) and Puppeteer for patrols every day.<br> If you are using server-side rendering frameworks like Next.JS, and cannot see the Travellings field in the view-source, it may not be detected by patrols.<br> You can try adding a comment with a travellings field to the public / index source code.<br> There may be plans to abolish patrols in the future, but so far, there is no good solution to such problems.<br> If you have any good ideas, please feel free to propose them to us.</p><h2 id="q-why-is-a-website-s-status-marked-as-run-but-i-can-t-access-it" tabindex="-1">Q: Why is a website&#39;s status marked as RUN, but I can&#39;t access it? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-why-is-a-website-s-status-marked-as-run-but-i-can-t-access-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Why is a website&#39;s status marked as RUN, but I can&#39;t access it?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Suppose a website performs well in coastal areas and loads smoothly, but cannot load in Tibet and other areas. In that case, Travellings will consider it normal. Therefore, you may encounter a very small number of abnormal URLs during the relay process. They can be opened in other areas. Currently, there is no solution to this problem.</p><h2 id="q-i-need-to-change-the-url-or-report-a-problematic-webpage-or-quit-travellings-or-contact-the-webmaster" tabindex="-1">Q: I need to change the URL or report a problematic webpage or quit Travellings or contact the webmaster. <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-i-need-to-change-the-url-or-report-a-problematic-webpage-or-quit-travellings-or-contact-the-webmaster" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: I need to change the URL or report a problematic webpage or quit Travellings or contact the webmaster.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: If you need to change the URL/name, please go to <a href="https://github.com/travellings-link/travellings/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Issues</a> and choose &quot;Request Information Change&quot; to fill it out.</p><p>If you need to report a problematic website to the maintenance team, please search for the corresponding site in <a href="https://list.travellings.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Members</a> and click on the Report (Flag) button on the right side to report it, and it will be processed as soon as possible.</p><p>If you need to provide feedback to the corresponding webmaster, it is recommended to search for the subdomain of the website you need to provide feedback on.
