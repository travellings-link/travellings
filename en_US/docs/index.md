## About Travellings

"Travellings" is a "web-roll-like" friend link relay project, aiming to direct traffic to those little-known independent sites through web redirection, thereby promoting the openness and diversity of the network.

This project was born on March 12, 2020, and its inspiration came from the open network.  Its Logo is composed of a star ring representing "the world" and a train representing "shuttle", just as we often hear on the train, "The train from xx to xx..."  The same, symbolizing shuttling through the online world.

Whenever a user visits the webpage that joins "Travellings", clicking the "To" button on that webpage will randomly redirect to another webpage that joins the project.  Whether you click "Drive to" again or back off the webpage, you will continue to be randomly redirected to the webpages of other participants.

As of now, "Travellings" has attracted the attention of over 1,000 people, and over 1,000 members have joined the project.  As more and more web pages choose to join the "Travellings" group, our friendly link network is also constantly expanding, which will further drive the growth of shared traffic and inject more vitality into this project.
