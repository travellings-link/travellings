## Development Philosophies

### Technology serves as a means to an end, enhancing efficiency and realizing purpose.

Our development philosophy is to serve the goals with technology and help improve efficiency. Whether it is minor adjustments or major changes, we are committed to achieving the goal of "one modification, one effect everywhere". Meanwhile, ensure that the information received by all parties is consistent and accurate, and achieve global updates and synchronization by maintaining a single GitHub repository, and provide a convenient way for users who have difficulty using GitHub to obtain information.
